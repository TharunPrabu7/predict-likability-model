I have created a survey asking people about how would one rate their partner or future partner's character.
I collected the data and created a model.
Then I created a webpage to deploy the model. Although the html is not my main goal, I've spent considerable amout of time in it. 
Now with just the inputs the model can create one's likability score and find out how many people from the survey like that person.
